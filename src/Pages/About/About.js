            <p>Last few months were pretty hectic with all these learning and assignments and it also brought some changes in my future goals. I realized that I have to make sure I am always in the process of learning things about web development. Because it is not a onetime learning session , and definitley not going to help me to build a career in this path. As I notices, there is always some changes and updates in technology and I have to keep up with this.</p>
            <p>  Adding to that, I want to say that my immediate goal would be to secure an internship or job.</p>
